Considerations for future improvements

- Allow management of sensors via Particle API
  - Add/view/update/remove/list sensors
  - Store the configuration in EEPROM
    - For example, 1-wire dallas sensors need an ID, could allow set/get of precision/alarms

- Search and report on found device IDs
  - Particle.variable with a callback method which does a search and responds with all devices on all configured busses
  - Is there a limit to the data size?
